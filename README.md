the AI icon

This is the AI icon, designed for indicating when a work is generated entirely using Artificial Intelligence, also known as 'synthetic data'. The Partly AI icon is to indicate when the result is only partly AI generated...

The icon was made by hand, digitally using vectors. The font used for the word 'partly' is Domus Semibold. The R and T have been stitched together manually. The colored version was originally made for the YouTube video thumbnail when I realised black and white looked very unattractive... There is only a pixel version of that.

I thought it would make more sense to place it here than on my personal website, which is something people used to do 20 years ago... Some might find it useful or see the need for improvements or different versions. I don't know anything else about Github so yeah... Cheers!
