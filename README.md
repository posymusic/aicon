# aicon
the AI icon

This is the A.I. icon, designed for indicating when a work is generated entirely using Artificial Intelligence, also known as 'synthetic data'.
The Partly AI icon is to indicate when the result is only partly AI generated...

I thought it would make more sense to place it here than on my personal website, which is somthing people used to do 20 years ago... I don't know anything else about Github so yeah... Cheers!
